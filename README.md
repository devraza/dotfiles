# Devraza's Dotfiles
These are my `bspwm` dotfiles, utilising:
- `rofi`
- `polybar`
- `feh`
- `sxhkd`
- `cava`
- `kitty`
- `picom`
- `starship` (the cross-shell prompt)
- `micro` (the text editor)
- `zathura`
- `neofetch`
- `dunst`

Fonts:
- `DejaVu Sans Mono`
- `Font Awesome [Pro]` for icons

**The [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) colour scheme is used wherever possible.**

I use **[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)** and the `xorg-xinit` package to start up X. The `.xinitrc` is located inside this repository.

Important applications are listed as follows, as well as their purpose:
- **Terminal Emulator:** `kitty`
- **Text Editor:** `micro` and `VSCodium`
- **Notification Daemon:** `dunst`
- **Compositor:** `picom`
- **System Fetch:** `neofetch`
- **Bar:** `polybar`
- **Audio Visualiser:** cava

An [install script](https://github.com/devraza/dotfiles/blob/main/install.sh) is in this repository if you want to install everything.
(However, it only works on Arch Linux with a yay install)
